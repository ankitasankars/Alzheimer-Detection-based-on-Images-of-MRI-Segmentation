<h1 align="center">Alzheimer Detection based on Images of MRI Segmentation</h1>
<h4 align="center"> Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurologic disorder that causes the brain to shrink (atrophy) and brain cells to die. It is the most common cause of dementia which is a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that affects a person's ability to function independently.
In its early stages, memory loss is mild, but with late-stage Alzheimer’s, individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment.<h4>

## Dataset used for this project:
	
I have chosen the [Alzheimer’s Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images) which contains data collected from various websites with each and every labels verified. The main goal is to build an end-to-end model to predict the stage of Alzheimer’s from MRI images.

The data consists of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images presented in the training and test set. The images are classified into four different classes according to the stage of the disease:
	
- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented
- Non Demented
- Very Mild Demented
