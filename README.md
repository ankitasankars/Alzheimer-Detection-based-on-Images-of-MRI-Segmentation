<h4 align="center"> Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurologic disorder that causes the brain to shrink (atrophy) and brain cells to die. It is the most common cause of dementia which is a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that affects a person's ability to function independently.
In its early stages, memory loss is mild, but with late-stage Alzheimerâ€™s, individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment.<h4>
